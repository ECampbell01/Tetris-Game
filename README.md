# Tetris

This project is a Tetris game created in Java that includes essential Tetris features. This game is designed for anyone who enjoys classic puzzle games. It is also an educational tool for those interested in object-oriented programming concepts, as the project demonstrates various OOP principles.

## Tech Stack

Java: The project was built entirely using Java, leveraging its object-oriented programming features and Java GUI (Swing) for the user interface.

## Installation

1. Download the JAR file: Download the [ JAR file for the Tetris Game](https://github.com/ECampbell01/Tetris-Game/blob/main/Tetris.jar).
2. Ensure Java is installed: Make sure you have Java installed on your system. You can check if Java is installed by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
java --version
```

3. If Java is not installed, you can download and install it from the[ official Java website](https://www.java.com/download/ie_manual.jsp).
4. Run the JAR file: Navigate to the directory where the downloaded JAR file is located and run it using the following command:

```bash
java -jar Tetris.jar
```

## Features

- Save and load functionality
- Background Music
- Pause Game
- Scoring System
- Block rotation

## Lessons Learned

Throughout the development of this project, I gained valuable experience and insights, including:

Java Programming: Deepened my understanding of Java, particularly in using object-oriented principles to structure the game.

Java GUI: Developed my skills in creating interactive graphical user interfaces using Java's Swing library, which was essential for building the gameâ€™s visual elements.

Object-Oriented Programming: Strengthened my knowledge of OOP concepts, such as inheritance, to organize and manage the game's structure and logic.

Key Events Handling: Gained hands-on experience in handling user input, such as key presses, to control game actions like moving and rotating blocks.

File Handling: Learned how to implement file-saving and loading functionality, enabling players to save their progress and load previous games.

These lessons were integral to completing the project and will serve as a solid foundation for future programming endeavors.
